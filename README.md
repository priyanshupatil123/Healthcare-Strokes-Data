Stroke:		
		
• Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood flow to the brain is interrupted or reduced,		
leading to brain cell damage.		


Types of Strokes:		

											
• Ischemic Stroke: Caused by a blood clot blocking a blood vessel in the brain											
• Hemorrhagic Stroke: Caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain											
• Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain, often referred to as a "mini-stroke"						


Modifiable Risk Factors:												
												
• High blood pressure (hypertension)												
• Smoking												
• Diabetes												
• High cholesterol												
• Physical inactivity												
												
                        
Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:												
												
• Age (risk increases with age)												
• Gender (more common in men)												
• Family history of strokes												


"Recognizing the Symptoms" Common symptoms of a stroke:												
												

* Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)												
* Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding												
* Severe headache with no known cause												
* Trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance												
* Importance of acting F.A.S.T. (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency services)												
												

Lets come to the data , so here I have a heathcare stroke prediction dataset.												
												

In which we have columns of age, gender, the diseases like hypertension (high blood-pressure), heart diseases,												
marital status (ever married), work type, residence type, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), Smoking status												
and stroke.												
												

A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL 												
(5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.												
												

• The average glucose level in this data is 106.14, which is is considered prediabetes.												
												

The average BMI is falls between 18.5 to 24.9, it will be considered as healthy range. If your BMI is 25.0 to 29.9, it falls within 												
the overweight range. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range												
												

• The average BMI in this data is 28.89 which is considered as overweight range. Mostly peoples are facing proble of overweight in it.												
												
Now lets come to the charts and graphs,												
												

• According to the above data it shows that the stroke is mostly happens in urban areas, while in rural area it is less												
as compared to urban area. It is 54% in urban area and in rural area it is 46%.												
												

• In this pie chart we can predicts that the genderwise stroke data, where stroke may be happens 												
mostly in females i.e. 57%, while in males it is 43%.												
												

• In this chart we can predict that the stroke is mostly occurs in private work type peoples , self-employed peoples, govt-job  												
peoples and childrens respectively. Whereas stroke is not occurs in those peoples who never worked.												
												

• In rural areas mostly people suffer from hypertension (high blood pressure). Patients of Heart diseases and 												
strokes both are also found in the same numbers in rural areas.												
												

• In this above pie-chart, stroke and heart disease are having almost same percentage, while mostly peoples												
may suffers from hypertension in urban areas also.												
												

• According to the above bar graph we can predict that the females are more suffering from stroke in rural and urban areas. 												


While males stroke rate is less as compared to females in both urban and rural areas.												
												

• Now lets come to the bar graph of strokes affect on smokers and non-smokers. According to the above bar graph we may predict that 												
those peoples who never smoked are having  maximum strokes. While formerly smoked person are also suffering from strokes.												

The person who smoke are having minimum strokes rates.
